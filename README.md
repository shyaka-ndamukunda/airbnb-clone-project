### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A well-designed booking system is crucial for success. It significantly reduces friction in the user journey, making it easier and more enjoyable for users to navigate, find what they need, and complete bookings. This, in turn, helps to increase conversion rates (more bookings) and leads to higher customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design are critical because users expect a seamless experience across all devices.
